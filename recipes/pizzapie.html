    <h1>The Best Pizza A Boy Could Ask For</h1>
    <img src="pizzapie.jpeg">
    <h2>Making homemade pizza dough can sound like a lot of work, but it’s so worth the bragging rights. The dough itself requires few ingredients and just a little bit of rising and rest time. While you wait for the dough to be ready, you can get to work prepping your tomato sauce, chopping fresh vegetables, or grating the cheese you’ll put on top. Bake for 15 minutes, garnish with basil (or, let’s be real, more cheese), and enjoy showing off your way-better-than-takeout creation</h2>
    <h2>So here is what we will need</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2.5 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>7 cups flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Now lets get started</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bloom the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yest in the warm water.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture.</li>
        <li>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 mintues.</li>
   
    </ol>
